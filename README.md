# Lab_tools
A library of lab tools I often use for my labbook / experimental design

random_block_design.py -> makes a randomised block design for experiments: under #setup change conditions to the type of coditions you have, and n = thhe number of replciates per condition

picking_random_lines_from_file.py -> picks random lines from a file for a given n: change n to how many lines you want

pcr_calc.py -> calculates the reagents needed for pcr and puts it out in nice standard format for labbook of either Phusion polymerase (NEB) or Q5 polymerase (NEB)

picking_random_lines_from_file.py -> calculates from your concentration and bp size of a overhang template how much you need to add for optimal ligation

check_sanger_seq.py -> checks all the fasta files in a given folder against a file called "ref", it then alligns them and puts them in an output file called "alligned".

batch_normalise_for_sequencing.py -> tells you how much water you need to add to DNA sample to get it normalised.

finding_all_unique_sequences_in_fasta.py -> make a file of unqiue possible sequences in a given range
